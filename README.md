# Machine Learning Projects: Fake News, Credit Card Fraud, and Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains Python scripts for three machine learning projects. Each project demonstrates a different predictive task using machine learning models.

---

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Fake News Prediction (`Fake_news_prediction.py`)**

* **Goal**: Classify news articles as fake or real.
* **Techniques**: Natural Language Processing (NLP), TF-IDF, and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forest).
* **Dataset**: Labeled news articles.

**Run the script**:

```bash
python Fake_news_prediction.py
```

---

### 2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection (`credit_card_fraud_detection.py`)**

* **Goal**: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
* **Techniques**: Classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, XGBoost) with class imbalance handling (SMOTE, undersampling).
* **Dataset**: Labeled transaction data (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent).

**Run the script**:

```bash
python credit_card_fraud_detection.py
```

---

### 3. **Wine Quality Prediction (`wine_quality_test_predictions.py`)**

* **Goal**: Predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical properties.
* **Techniques**: Regression models (e.g., Random Forest Regressor) for predicting quality scores.
* **Dataset**: Features like acidity, alcohol, pH to predict wine quality.

**Run the script**:

```bash
python wine_quality_test_predictions.py
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Clone this repository and create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Scripts

After setting up, simply run the respective script:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

For example:

```bash
python Fake_news_prediction.py
```
